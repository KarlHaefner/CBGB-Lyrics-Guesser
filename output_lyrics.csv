I was dreaming in my dreaming Of an aspect bright and fair And my sleeping it was broken But my dream it lingered near In the form of shining valleys Where the pure air recognized And my senses newly opened I awakened to the cry That the people have the power To redeem the work of fools Upon the meek the graces shower It' s decreed the people rule The people have the power The people have the power The people have the power The people have the power Vengeful aspects became suspect And bending low as if to hear And the armies ceased advancing Because the people had their ear And the shepherds and the soldiers Lay beneath the stars Exchanging visions And laying arms To waste in the dust In the form of shining valleys Where the pure air recognized And my senses newly opened I awakened to the cry Where there were deserts I saw fountains Like cream the waters rise And we strolled there together With none to laugh or criticize And the leopard And the lamb Lay together truly bound I was hoping in my hoping To recall what I had found I was dreaming in my dreaming God knows a purer view As I surrender to my sleeping I commit my dream to you Where there were deserts I saw fountains Like cream the waters rise And we strolled there together With none to laugh or criticize And the leopard And the lamb Lay together truly bound I was hoping in my hoping To recall what I had found I was dreaming in my dreaming God knows a purer view As I surrender to my sleeping I commit my dream to you The power to dream to rule To wrestle the world from fools It' s decreed the people rule It' s decreed the people rule I believe everything we dream Can come to pass through our union We can turn the world around We can turn the earth' s revolution We have the power People have the power,Patti Smith
"Oh, help me in my weakness,"" I heard the drifter say, As they carried him from the courtroom And were taking him away. ""My trip hasn't been a pleasant one And my time it isn't long, And I still do not know What it was that I've done wrong."" Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside, A tear came to his eye, ""You fail to understand,"" he said, ""Why must you even try?"" Outside, the crowd was stirring, You could hear it from the door. Inside, the judge was stepping down, While the jury cried for more. ""Oh, stop that cursed jury,"" Cried the attendant and the nurse, ""The trial was bad enough, But this is ten times worse."" Just then a bolt of lightning Struck the courthouse out of shape, And while ev'rybody knelt to pray The drifter did escape.",Patti Smith

"In Arezzo I dreamed a dream Of Saint Francis who kneeled and prayed For the birds and the beasts and all humankind. All through the night I felt drawn in by him And I heard him call Like a distant hymn I retreated from the silence of my room Stepping down the ancient stones washed with dawn And entered the basilica that bore his name Seeing his effigy I bowed my head And my racing heart I gave to him I kneeled and prayed And the sleep that I could not find in the night I found through him I saw before me the world of his world The bright fields, the birds in abundance All of nature of which he sang Singing of him All the beauty that surrounded him as he walked His nature that was nature itself And I heard him - I heard him speak And the birds sang sweetly And the wolves licked his feet. (O Signore, fa' che sia strumento della tua Pace: Dove c’è odio, lascia che sia Amore. Dove c’è offesa, Perdono. Dove c’è dubbio, Fede. Dove c’è disperazione, Speranza. Dove c’è oscurità, Luce. Dove c’è tristezza, Gioia. Fa' ch'io non cerchi tanto Di essere consolato, quanto consolare. Di essere compreso, quanto comprendere. Di essere amato, quanto amare.) But I could not give myself to him I felt another call from the basilica itself The call of art - the call of man And the beauty of the material drew me away And I awoke, and beheld upon the wall The dream of Constantine The handiwork of Piero della Francesca Who had stood where I stood With his brush stroked The Legend of the True Cross He envisioned Constantine advancing to greet the enemy But as he was passing the river An unaccustomed fear gripped his bowels An anticipation so overwhelming that it manifested in waves All through the night a dream drew toward him As an advancing Crusade He slept in his tent on the battlefield While his men stood guard And an angel awoke him Constantine within his dream awoke And his men saw a light pass over the face of the King The troubled King And the angel came and showed to him The sign of the true cross in heaven And upon it was written In this sign shall thou conquer In the distance the tents of his army were lit by moonlight But another kind of radiance lit the face of Constantine And in the morning light The artist, seeing his work was done Saw that it was good In this sign shall thou conquer He let his brush drop and passed into a sleep of his own And he dreamed of Constantine carrying into battle in his right hand An immaculate, undefiled single white Cross Piero della Francesca, as his brush stroked the wall Was filled with a torpor And fell into a dream of his own From the geometry of his heart he mapped it out He saw the King rise, fitted with armor Set upon a white horse An immaculate cross in his right hand. He advanced toward the enemy And the symmetry, the perfection of his mathematics Caused the scattering of the enemy Agitated, broken, they fled And Piero della Francesca waking, cried out All is art - all is future! Oh Lord let me die on the back of adventure With a brush and an eye full of light But as he advanced in age The light was shorn from his eyes And blinded, he laid upon his bed On an October morning 1492, and whispered Oh Lord let me die on the back of adventure Oh Lord let me die on the back of adventure And a world away - a world away On three great ships Adventure itself as if to answer Pulling into the New World And as far as his eyes could see No longer blind All of nature unspoiled - beautiful - beautiful In such a manner that would have lifted the heart of St. Francis Into the realm of universal love Columbus stepped foot on the New World And witnessed beauty unspoiled All the delights given by God As if an Eden itself, as if Eden had opened her heart to him And opened her dress And all of her fruit gave to him And Columbus so overwhelmed Fell into a sleep of his own All the world in his sleep All of the beauty, all of the beauty entwined with the future The twenty-first century Advancing like the angel Advancing like the angel That had come To Constantine Constantine in his dream Oh this is your cross to bear Oh Lord Oh Lord let me deliver Hallowed adventure to all mankind In the future Oh art cried the painter Oh art - Oh art - cried the angel Art the great material gift of man Art that hath denied The humble pleas of St. Francis Oh thou Artist All shall crumble into dust Oh thou navigator The terrible end of man This is your gift to mankind This is your cross to bear And Columbus saw all of nature aflame The apocalyptic night And the dream of the troubled King Dissolved into light",Patti Smith
"Loyalty rests in the heart of a dog Don't set all your eggs on the back of a frog You can lick it twice but it won't lick you And salvating salvation gone so long so Loyalty lives and we don't know why And the paw is pressed against the nerve of the sky You can leave him behind but he won't leave you And the road to Heaven is true - true blue Banga Say - Banga Say - Banga Loyalty lives and we don't know why And his paws are pressed to the spine of the sky You can leave him twice, but he won't leave you And the way to Heaven is true - true blue Say - Banga Say - Banga Say - Banga Say - Banga",Patti Smith

Oh, I was undulating in the lewd impostered night. Steeped in a dream to rend the seams to redeem the rock of right. Swept through the seas of Galilee and the Seven Hills of Rome. Seven sins were wrung from the sight of me, Lo I turned my neck toward home. Ah, I opened up my arms to You, and we spun from life to life, 'Til you loosened me and let me go toward the everlasting light. In this big step I am taking seven seizures for the true. I got seven ways of going, seven ways of serving You. As I move through seven levels As I move upon the slate As I declare to you The number of my moves As I speculate the eighth Seeking love without exception A light upon the swarm Seeking love without exception A saint in any form.",Patti Smith

Break it up, don't talk to me that way, I'm not listening.” Snow started falling, I could hear the angel calling. We rolled on the ground, he stretched out his wings.

Break it up, don't look at me.” The sky was raging, the boy disappeared, I fell on my knee Atmosphere broke up, the boy reappeared. I cried, “Take me please!” Ice, it was shining.

Maybe I’m just too demanding Maybe I’m just like my father, too bold Maybe, I'm just like my mother She’s never satisfied Why must we scream at each other? This is what it sounds like when doves cry Dream if you can, courtyard Ocean of violets in bloom Animals strike curious poses They feel the heat, the heat between me and you How can you just leave me standing Alone in a world so cold? Maybe I’m just too demanding Maybe I’m just like my father, too bold Maybe, I'm just like my mother She’s never satisfied Why must we scream at each other?

Hail brother The distant thunder Is nothing but hearts Beating as one Dance of a million On God's pavilion Come come Beat on your drum Awake people arise Awake upright come Fortune is falling like Tears from the skies Open your eyes Hail sister Come on over To shape reshape Things to come Bow your head Raise your lantern Come come Beat on your drum Awake people arise Awake upright come Fortune is falling like Tears from the skies Open your eyes United action is what we need Time to say that everything is going to be Wasted icons wasted lives Like war obsolete Awake people arise Awake upright come Fortune is falling like Tears from the skies Open your eyes These are the times The times of our own These are the shapes The world we formed Swift is the arrow Dark is the thorn The slate is clean The future awaits Awake,Patti Smith
I looked upon the book of life Tracing the lines of face after face Looking down at their naked feet Bound in chains bound in chains Chains of leather chains of gold We knew it was wrong but we looked away And paraded them down the colonial streets And that's how they became enslaved They came across on the great ships Mothers separated from their babes Husbands stood on the auction block Bound in chains bound in chains Chains of leather chains of gold Men knew it was wrong but they looked away And led them to toil in fields of white As they turned their necks to a bitter landscape Oh the people I hear them calling Am I not a man and a brother Am I not a woman and a sister History sends us such strange messengers They come down through time To embrace to enrage And in their arms even stranger fruit And they swing from the trees With their vision in flames Ropes of leather ropes of gold Men knew it was wrong but they looked away Messengers swinging from twisted rope As they turned their necks to a bitter landscape Oh the people I hear them calling Am I not a man and a brother Am I not a woman and a sister We will be heard we will be heard,Patti Smith
What is the system that gets around Recruits hearts with its timeless rhythm The young glow but old men know It's all a part of some crazy schism Coming on like the dawn unrelenting light Streets thick with its radiating It's all aglow but we all know True love is so complicated Feeling funny don't know why On a plane circling high Equation persuasion It's just persuasion What is the body that has nobody Go through life with nobody at all It come and go where the wind blow When persuasion come to call Got me reeling don't know why I'm on a plane circling high Equation persuasion Got the feeling I'm running in place Caught in the orbit of the human race Equation persuasion It's just persuasion It's jut persuasion It's just persuasion What is the body that has nobody What is the rise without the fall What is illusion without beauty What is the system that's no system at all Hey scout there's no equation You can't prepare for the heart's invasion You can't prepare for the heart's invasion Love is its own,Patti Smith

"Hello darkness, my old friend I've come to talk with you again Because a vision softly creeping Left its seeds while I was sleeping And the vision that was planted in my brain Still remains Within the sound of silence In restless dreams I walked alone Narrow streets of cobblestone 'Neath the halo of a street lamp I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light That split the night And touched the sound of silence And in the naked light I saw Ten thousand people, maybe more People talking without speaking People hearing without listening People writing songs that voices never share No one dared Disturb the sound of silence ""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know Silence like a cancer grows Hear my words that I might teach you Take my arms that I might reach you"" But my words like silent raindrops fell And echoed in the wells of silence And the people bowed and prayed To the neon god they made And the sign flashed out its warning In the words that it was forming And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets Are written on the subway walls And tenement halls"" And whispered in the sounds of silence",Simon & Garfunkel

"What I feel when I'm playing guitar Is completely cold and crazy, Like I don't owe nobody nothing And it's just a test just to see How far I can relax Into the cold wave of a note. When everything hits just right (just and right) The note of nobility can go on forever. I never tire of the solitary E And I trust my guitar And I don't care about anything. Sometimes I feel like I've broken through And I'm free and I could dig into eternity Into eternity riding the wave And realm of the E. Sometimes it's useless. Here I am struggling and filled with dread Afraid that I'll never squeeze enough Graphite from my damaged cranium To inspire or asphyxiate any eyes Grazing like hungry cows across the stage or page. Inside of me I'm crazy I'm just crazy. Inside I must continue. I see her, my stiff muse, Jutting around round round Round like a broken speeding statue. The colonial year is dead And the Greeks too are finished. The face of Alexander remains not only solely Due to sculpture but through the power and foresight And magnetism of Alexander himself.

"His father died and left him a little farm in New England. All the long black funeral cars left the scene And the boy was just standing there alone Looking at the shiny red tractor Him and his daddy used to sit inside And circle the blue fields and grease the night. It was if someone had spread butter on all the fine points of the stars 'Cause when he looked up they started to slip. Then he put his head in the crux of his arm And he started to drift, drift to the belly of a ship, Let the ship slide open, and he went inside of it And saw his daddy 'hind the control board streamin' beads of light, He saw his daddy 'hind the control board, And he was very different tonight 'Cause he was not human, he was not human. Little boy's face lit up with such naked joy That the sun burned around his lids and his eyes were like two suns, White lids, white opals, seeing everything just a little bit too clearly And he looked around and there was no black ship in sight, No black funeral cars, nothing except for him, the raven And fell on his knees and looked up and cried out, No, daddy, don't leave me here alone, Take me up, daddy, to the belly of your ship, Let the ship slide open and I'll go inside of it Where you're not human, you are not human. But nobody heard the boy's cry of alarm. Nobody there 'cept for the birds around the New England farm And they gathered in all directions, like roses they scattered And they were like compass grass coming together into the head of a shaman bouquet Slit in his nose and all the others went shooting And he saw the lights of traffic beckoning like the hands of Blake Grabbing at his cheeks, taking out his neck, All his limbs, everything was twisted and he said, I won't give up, won't give up, don't let me give up, I won't give up, come here, let me go up fast, Take me up quick, take me up, up to the belly of a ship And the ship slides open and I go inside of it, where I am not human. I am helium raven and this movie is mine, So he cried out as he stretched the sky, Pushing it all out like latex cartoon, am I all alone in this generation? We'll just be dreaming of animation night and day And won't let up, won't let up and I see them coming in, Oh, I couldn't hear them before, but I hear 'em now, It's a radar scope in all silver and all platinum lights Moving in like black ships, they were moving in, streams of them, And he put up his hands and he said, ""It's me, it's me, I'll give you my eyes, take me up, oh now please take me up, I'm helium raven waitin' for you, please take me up, Don't leave me here!"" The sun, the sign, the cross, Like the shape of a tortured woman, the true shape of a tortured woman, The mother standing in the doorway letting her sons No longer presidents but prophets They're all dreaming they're gonna bear the prophet, He's gonna run through the fields dreaming in animation It's all gonna split his skull It's gonna come out like a black bouquet shining Like a fist that's gonna shoot them up Like light, like Mohamed Boxer Take them up up up up up up Oh, let's go up, up, take me up, I'll go up, I'm going up, I'm going up Take me up, I'm going up, I'll go up there Go up go up go up go up up up up up up up Up, up to the belly of a ship. Let the ship slide open and we'll go inside of it Where we are not human, we're not human. Well, there was sand, there were tiles, The sun had melted the sand and it coagulated Like a river of glass When it hardened he looked at the surface He saw his face And where there were eyes were just two white opals, two white opals, Where there were eyes there were just two white opals And he looked up and the rays shot And he saw, raven comin' in And he crawled on his back and he went up Up up up up up up Sha da do wop, da shaman do way, sha da do wop, da shaman do way, Sha da do wop, da shaman do way, sha da do wop, da shaman do way, Sha da do wop, da shaman do way, We like Birdland.",Patti Smith

A more hooked nose...wider, thinner lips...beady eyes...a larger forehead. He imagined that this was an ability he shared with most other people... They had also molded their faced according to some ideal... Maybe they imagined that their new face would better Suit their personality...Or maybe they imagined that their Personality would be forced to change to fit the new appearance...

Any intrusion is met with a heart full of the good thing. Try to compare what I am presenting. You will meet with much frustration. Try to find ... similar situation. You will always find the same solution. As the heart finds the good thing, the feeling is multiplied. Add the will to the strength and it equals conviction. As we economize, efficiency is multiplied, To the extent I am determined the result is the good thing.

"Greetings Ladies and Gentlemen of Earth and all native intelligences of the forty planets, satellites, moons, stars, and any other inhabited orbs with contestants entered in the annual Grande Trex, the only inter-galactic race. This year's event promises excitement to surpass all previous races. As many of you fans already know the route or track of the orbits, glides, etc. has been increased by 5,000 million kilometers thus enabling Grande Trex to include the be 'Arc System, in our present event and for all succeeding GT races. Dragonfly Dragonfly Satellite Strike and fight Laser light shot tonight Target nullified Gyro subdivide Latitude longitude Satellite Solid substitute What's a drag race? Can't you see those dragons Speeding up the street But I learned they weren't real Figments of the ancient fear Rapid scan radians For the chance To win the Grande Maneuvers preprogramme Windage Won't operate Negative bearing swell Dragons fly they symbolize in myth and saga breathing fire Look up there's one flying higher Faster than the SCC Is science hiding witchery? Grande Trex fans throughout the universe are well informed on the risks pilots take in entering this race, i.e. re-entry into some of the alien atmospheres is tricky business which can cause a craft to implode, explode, melt, lose automatic structure, etc., while en route. The craft are scheduled to surface launch 0700.5100 Greenwich time and are assembled on one of our very own stars, Neutron Einstar EV 9. The excitement is at a fevered pitch as the countdown approaches zero. These hypersonic inertial transition ships can calculate the negligible quantity of spherical differential for tight orbit, are sonar-radar balanced and translate windage occurrence, offset verniers, retrieve, execute prepare, delay code and report astrogational error in a micro-second. Naturally these specialized craft are equipped with apparatus capable of highly sensitive maneuverability. They can dive, sweep, run random parallel paths, alternate axes, circumnavigate for rapid survey, spin, count milibaricly while simultaneously displaying an accurate diagram grid for safety measures, not to mention the quanta limitation fixtures for sea level, ground level, level off, and hover bearings. We have retained as an added feature to stimulate more thrills, the computer over-ride for a three and one half hours to two gens during which pilots and co-pilots manually control free-fall, latitude, longitude, protact gravity, revise dimensional equations, run programme checks, submerge in the wild oceans of Jonrin 22, to photograph as much territory as they can in addition to the requisite three thousand automatic shots. The postulate for mischance runs high but not as high as the tension and competitive spirit right here on Earth and all over the 4 galaxies represented in this Seventh Grande Trex.

"Je veux dédier ce poème A toutes les femmes qu'on aime Pendant quelques instants secrets A celles qu'on connaît à peine Qu'un destin différent entraîne Et qu'on ne retrouve jamais A celle qu'on voit apparaître Une seconde à sa fenêtre Et qui, preste, s'évanouit Mais dont la svelte silhouette Est si gracieuse et fluette Qu'on en demeure épanoui A la compagne de voyage Dont les yeux, charmant paysage Font paraître court le chemin Qu'on est seul, peut-être, à comprendre Et qu'on laisse pourtant descendre Sans avoir effleuré sa main A la fine et souple valseuse Qui vous sembla triste et nerveuse Par une nuit de carnaval Qui voulu rester inconnue Et qui n'est jamais revenue Tournoyer dans un autre bal A celles qui sont déjà prises Et qui, vivant des heures grises Près d'un être trop différent Vous ont, inutile folie, Laissé voir la mélancolie D'un avenir désespérant Chères images aperçues Espérances d'un jour déçues Vous serez dans l'oubli demain Pour peu que le bonheur survienne Il est rare qu'on se souvienne Des épisodes du chemin Mais si l'on a manqué sa vie On songe avec un peu d'envie A tous ces bonheurs entrevus Aux baisers qu'on n'osa pas prendre Aux curs qui doivent vous attendre Aux yeux qu'on n'a jamais revus Alors, aux soirs de lassitude Tout en peuplant sa solitude Des fantômes du souvenir On pleure les lèvres absentes De toutes ces belles passantes Que l'on n'a pas su retenir",Iggy Pop
Each place I go only the lonely go Some little small cafe The songs I know only the lonely know Each melody recalls a love that used to be The dreams I dream only the lonely dream Of lips as warm as May That hopeless scheme only the lonely scheme That soon somewhere you'll find the one that used to care And you recall each fun time Those picnics at the beach when love was new It well could be the one time A hopeless little dream like that comes true If you find love hang on to each caress And never let love go For when it's gone you'll know the loneliness The heartbreak only the lonely know,Iggy Pop

"Everybody's talking at me I don't hear a word they're saying Only the echoes of my mind People stopping staring I can't see their faces Only the shadows of their eyes I'm going where the sun keeps shining Through the pouring rain Going where the weather suits my clothes Backing off of the North East winds Sailing on a summer breeze And skipping over the ocean like a stone Oh I'm going where the sun keeps shining Through' the pouring rain Going where the weather suits my clothes Backing off of the North East winds Sailing on a summer breeze And skipping over the ocean like a stone Everybody's talking at me I don't hear a word they're saying Only the echoes of my mind I won't let you leave my love behind No, I won't let you leave I won't let you leave my love behind",Iggy Pop
"Et si tu n’existais pas, Dis-moi pourquoi j’existerais? Pour traîner dans un monde sans toi, Sans espoir et sans regrets. Et si tu n’existais pas, J’essaierais d’inventer l’amour, Comme un peintre qui voit sous ses doigts Naître les couleurs du jour. Et qui n’en revient pas. Et si tu n’existais pas, Dis-moi pour qui j’existerais? Des passantes endormies dans mes bras Que je n’aimerais jamais. Et si tu n’existais pas, Je ne serais qu’un point de plus Dans ce monde qui vient et qui va, Je me sentirais perdu, J’aurais besoin de toi. Et si tu n’existais pas, Dis-moi comment j’existerais? Je pourrais faire semblant d’être moi, Mais je ne serais pas vrai. Et si tu n’existais pas, Je crois que je l’aurais trouvé, Le secret de la vie, le pourquoi, Simplement pour te créer Et pour te regarder.",Iggy Pop

"Two weeks after my arrival Fox died just after sunset I was stretched out on the bed when he approached And tried painfully to jump up he wagged his tail nervously Since the beginning he hadn't touched his bowl once He had lost a lot of weight I helped him to settle on my lap For a few seconds he looked at me With a curious mixture of exhaustion and apology Then, calmed, he closed his eyes Two minutes later he gave out his last breath I buried him beside the residence At the western extremity of the land Surrounded by the protective fence Next to his predecessors During the night a rapid transport From the Central City dropped off an identical dog They knew the codes and how to work the barrier I didn't have to get up to greet them A small white and ginger mongrel Came toward me wagging its tail I gestured to him He jumped on the bed and stretched out beside me Love is simple to define But it seldom happens in the series of beings Through these dogs we pay homage to love And to its possibility What is a dog but a machine for loving You introduce him to a human being giving him the mission to love And however ugly, perverse, deformed or stupid this human being might be The dog loves him, the dog loves him",Iggy Pop

No more good tables at the restaurants, No more strange women smiling and approaching me on the streets, No more top notch booty No more entourage to say ""Right boss"" I began to have nightmares And in my nightmares, I was just a fucking nobody. Laying at the beach, imagining myself being a VIP! Just like I was before, Hearing the applause in my head Beautiful warm embraces of superior members of the female gender V.I.P V.I.P Of course, when one becomes a V.I.P, One meets other V.I.Ps At social occasions, And one inevitably thinks, ""thick! How shallow and crass these people are! They're not down to earth and real like me, Oh no! I'm a very special V.I.P"" Another interesting phenomenon, associated with V.I.P celebrity hood, Is the ""V.I.P reflection effect"", during which anyone associated with the V.I.P, Becomes a sort of V.I.P in their own right! Such as ""son OF the V.I.P"", ""Guitar player FOR the V.I.P"", ""Girlfriend WITH the V.I.P"", ""Accountants of the V.I.P"" The maid, the dog, the music publisher, huh! All enjoy a sort of 'reflected glory', as in ""Hi this is Nastea I work for Iggy And I'd like 6 tables tonight in the V.I.P section And he needs passes for everyone And free drinks of course In the V.I.P area"" Right on boss Cause I'm a V.I.P. It's also true that when one is a V.I.P, everybody's happy to see you, all the time! And there's an implicit rule that a V.I.P must never, never Be on a barn. Cause everybody expects YOU to make their day And they're all be on to you if you're in a bad mood. They will ""thck!tchk!tchk ! mur mur mur mur mur!"", And you will find yourself with the wrong kind of attention: A ""difficult"" V.I.P. Psychologists tell us that a sense of self-esteem Is so necessary in today's world. As a V.I.P, I can guarantee you, you'll never be alone. You'll never be alone. Cause you're a V.I.P!",Iggy Pop
